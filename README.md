Project Title
LinG3D: Visualizing the Spatio-Temporal Dynamics of Clonal Evolution

Description
This code generates the 3D lineage trees of (1) all clones; (2) individual clones; (3) all clones , but with only those cells that survived to the end of simulation; and (4) individual clones containing only those cells that survived to the end of simulation – see the quick guide to LinG3D routines.

The code is generated in Python


Getting started: 

It requires the following libraries: Numpy, Scipy, Matplotlib
